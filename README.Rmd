# OA diagnosis gaps

This repository contains the data and code for our project estimating the rate of missing OA diagnoses in primary care in NZ.

The data files provided here are aggregated data obtained from the Stats NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). The underlying individual patient data are not publicly available due to confidentiality provisions of the IDI. Access to the IDI may be made available by Stats NZ to approved New Zealand-based reseachers; see <https://stats.govt.nz/idi> for more information.

## How to use

The project uses [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for package version/dependency management, and [`{targets}`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) to specify the data analytic workflow. When opening the project for the first time, `{renv}` should prompt you to download and install the required package versions; if it does not, use `renv::restore()` to do this manually.

The project pipeline can then be built using `targets::tar_make()` to recreate all of the tables and figures presented in the manuscript.
