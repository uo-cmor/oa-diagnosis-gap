# OA diagnosis gaps

This repository contains the data and code for our project estimating
the rate of missing OA diagnoses in primary care in NZ.

The data files provided here are aggregated data obtained from the Stats
NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). The underlying individual
patient data are not publicly available due to confidentiality
provisions of the IDI. Access to the IDI may be made available by Stats
NZ to approved New Zealand-based reseachers; see
<https://stats.govt.nz/idi> for more information.
